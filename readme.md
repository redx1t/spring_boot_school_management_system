BREAKDOWN OF SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

HOW TO RUN

BACKEND RESTFUL API - SPRING BOOT JAVA

git pull into your working folder. 

reload dependancies via maven, environment tested in: java 11 version

make sure applications.properties has the right credetials for DB as well as the postgres version

<!- I am using POSTGRES with a database called school_management_system -!!>

run build from SchoolManagementSystemApplicationClass


FRONT END - NEXT JS

git pull from and follow the instruction. ensure that it runs on port 8080 on server side and port 3000 on the front end. You can configure both in the configs folder in the next js app or configure the cors on the security/securityconfig class

Understanding system architecture

Key words, precisely describing 

dont miss out all the functions

Operand - what generates the value

Attribute associated with the value. 

Example: Refrigerator

Food

Goal - reduce spoilage rate
Processes - Chilling, radiate, dry, preserving, marinating, smoking, vacuum packing the food or eating it :)

Form - its function } makes up the device

Always consider the elements of the system. for a fridge, its 
food
support structure
heat load
operator

Process is

Take the requirement, understand the breakdown the system

Factors such as 
security
performance
resource utilization

NASA Standards
- decomposition
    - understanding of technical requirements
    - conversion of the technical breakdown into models
Logical Decompostion
- input
- activities
- output

Does involve factors such as 
- Brainstorming
    - Should have a driving question

- structural software system i.e. 
    - blueprint for building a software
    - breakdown components, relationship btwn components, data & algorithm structures,  data flow, control flow, dependancies etc

Its all about making systems simple. make it simple

Consider qualities: performance, availability, usability, scalibility, safety

Technical 
- Monolithic
- Layed
- Microservices
